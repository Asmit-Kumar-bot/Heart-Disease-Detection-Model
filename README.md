# Heart Disease Prediction Model 🫀💻

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on various medical parameters.

## 📁 Files
- `Heart_disease_prediction.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing model training and testing.
- `dataset.csv`: Dataset used to train the model.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.
- `logisticregression.pkl` – Saved Logistic Regression model file.
- `Heart_disease_prediction_app.py` – Streamlit application script for heart disease prediction.

## 🧠 Libraries Used
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## 🧪 Features Used
- Age
- Sex
- Chest Pain Type (`cp`)
- Resting Blood Pressure (`trestbps`)
- Cholesterol (`chol`)
- Fasting Blood Sugar (`fbs`)
- Resting ECG (`restecg`)
- Max Heart Rate (`thalach`)
- Exercise Induced Angina (`exang`)
- ST Depression (`oldpeak`)
- Slope of ST Segment (`slope`)
- Number of Major Vessels (`ca`)
- Thalassemia (`thal`)

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Asmit-Kumar-bot/Heart-Disease-Detection-Model.git
   cd Heart-Disease-Detection-Model

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Open the notebook:
   jupyter notebook Heart_disease_prediction.ipynb

4. Run all cells to train the model and view results.
